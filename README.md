## General

### Refactoring

> **Make Your Code Cleaner (by [@idnzozkan](https://github.com/idnzozkan))**

```text
Refactor the code to improve readability and maintain high code quality by adhering to the principles outlined in Clean Code by Robert C. Martin. Focus on making the code more concise and structured, using meaningful names, eliminating redundancies, and ensuring clear separation of concerns. Preserve the existing logic and functionality. Add clear comments when needed but avoid adding unnecessary comments; instead, let the code itself communicate its purpose effectively.
```
